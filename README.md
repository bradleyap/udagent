# udagent

The python agent provided by udagent.py runs locally and in the background for users of the Unitraverse browser application. This agent becomes the server handling calls from the user agent running on a specific port when the user access http&#47;&#47;:localhost:&lt;port&gt;

'udagent.py' runs in a unitraverse installation directory and gives access to the 'images' directory at that location, as well as files anywhere in the user's computer when they are accessible for the user.

This access allows the browser application to organize local resources (files) together with the browser links that should logically belong to the same workflow or context.
